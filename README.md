# Readme-Generator

## Description
I wanted to use the command-line to create an application that creates a detailed README.md file for the user. 
This way they can spend less time typing up a readme and more time focusing on their project.

## Installation
Use the command 'npm start' to run the application and answer the following prompts.

## Usage
